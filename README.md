Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree - Project 5

Why this project?

Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process.


Project Details:-

       Dataset: Ford GoBike

       Explore the data: Feel free to explore the jupyter notebook where the dataset is visually, and programatically explored.

       Document the story: organized findings convey a story to present to an audience.

       Communicate the findings - a slide deck with my findings is prepared for a curious audience.


Files:-
            readme.md - This Markdown file contains sections that you should fill out as you select your dataset, complete your                              exploration,and plan your explanatory analysis.

          exploration_template.ipynb - This Jupyter Notebook contains section templates to help you organize your exploration,                                             starting from loading in the data, working through univariate visualizations, and                                              with bivariate and multivariate exploration.

           slide_deck_template.ipynb - This Jupyter Notebook contains starter cells to help you organize your slide deck                                                   deliverable. These cells provide an example of how the slide deck should be                                                          organized,including pre-set slideshow settings.
To view the slide deck, you will need to use the expression (all one line): jupyter nbconvert Example_Project_Diamonds_Part2.ipynb --to slides --post serve --template output_toggle

output_toggle.tpl - This template file can be used with nbconvert to export your slide deck. This adds extra functionality to the slide deck by hiding the code to start, only making it visible if the reader clicks on the output (which should mostly be visualizations in the case of this project).
